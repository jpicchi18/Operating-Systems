DESCRIPTION OF EACH FILE IN "lab1b.tar.gz":
    "lab1b-client.c":
            A C source module that compiles cleanly into the executable "lab1b-client",
            which implements the client side of the pogram. The compiled client module
            connects with the server module via a socket over the network, and it sends
            data back and forth until one of several terminating events is encountered.
            This program has all functionality specified in the project 1b spec, including:
                --> "--compress": compresses data before sending it to the server, and
                                 decompresses data after recieving it from the server.
                --> "--port=num": a required flag that specifies the port number onto which
                                the client should connect the socket.
                --> "--log=filename": specifies a file to which a log will be written of all
                                data transfered to and from the server over the network.
                --> "--host=hostname": allows the user to specify a particular hostname
                                if the server program is running on a different machine.
                --> "--debug" : an optional flag that prints additional debugging messages
                                to stderr for the purposes of program development.

    "lab1b-server.c":
            A C source module that compiles cleanly into the executable "lab1b-server",
            which implements the server side of the program. The compiled server module
            connects with the client via a socket over the network, and sends data back
            and forth until one of several terminating sequences is encountered.
            This has all functinoaly specified in the project 1b specification, including:
                --> "--compress": compresses data before sending it to the client, and
                                 decompresses data after recieving it from the client.
                --> "--port=num": a required flag that specifies the port number onto which
                                the server should connect the socket.
                --> "--debug" : an optional flag that prints additional debugging messages
                                to stderr for the purposes of program development.

    "Makefile":
            A Makefile to with several targets to build the client and server programs,
            clean the working directory, and create a tarball to distribute the files.
            The Makefile contains the following targets:
                --> "default"
                            Lists "lab1b-client" and "lab1b-server" as dependencies.
                --> "lab1b-client"
                            Compiles the "lab1b-client.c" source module using the
                            flags "-Wall", "-Wextra", and "-lz".
                --> "lab1b-server"
                            Compiles the "lab1b-server.c" source module using the
                            flags "-Wall", "-Wextra", and "-lz".
                --> "clean"
                            Removes the files "lab1b-605124511.tar.gz", "lab1b-client",
                            and "lab1b-server" from the working directory.
                --> "dist"
                            Creates a compressed tarball containing the all of the
                            files listed in this "README".

    "README"
            This file, which contains a description of the contents of the tarball
            "lab1b-605124511.tar.gz" and all of its constituent programs.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES:
    Apart from those listed in the spec, the additional features of the client include a "--debug"
    flag that prints helpful debugging messages for the purpose of program development, as well
    as a "--host=hostname" flag that allows the user to specify a host in the case that the server
    is running on a different machine on the network (ie not "localhost").

    The only additional feature of the server is a "--debug" flag that prints helpful debugging
    messages for the purpose of program development.


TESTING METHODOLOGY:
    I tested the program incrementally with each development/added feature so as to ensure that
    there were no outstanding bugs at any one phase of the program's evolution. Much of this
    debugging was facilitated by the incorporation of a "--debug" flag in both the server
    and client programs that printed helpful messages to stderr in order to track down
    phases of program execution.
