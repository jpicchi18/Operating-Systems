DESCRIPTION OF FILES INCLUDED IN "lab3b.tar.gz":

--> lab3b.py
        A Python source script written in Python 3 that implements the program functionality specified in the
        Project 3B specifications. The program can be run by calling a symbolic link to this script,
        which is created by the "default" option in the "Makefile".

--> Makefile
        A Makefile to build and run the desired program, as well as to create a tarball and clean the
        working directory. This Makefile contains the following targets:
        --> "lab3b (default)"
                    Creates a symbolic link called "lab3b", which contains the absolute path to the
                    "lab3b.py" script. This target also adds execute permissions to the "lab3b" symbolic
                    link using "chmod a+x".
        --> "dist":
                    Creates a compressed tarball containing all of the files described in this README,
                    thus creating a valid submission for the project.

        --> "clean":
                    Deletes all programs and output generated by the Makefile (ie the "lab3b" symbolic
                    link and the "lab3b-605124511.tar.gz" tarball).

--> README:
        The file you are currently reading, which contains descriptions of each file included in
        "lab3b-605124511.tar.gz", as well as additional descriptions of features and characteristics
        relevant to the program and development process.


RESEARCH SOURCES:
--> all slides (especially those containing pseudocode) in the powerpoint presentation "Discussion_Week9"
--> Project 3A spec
--> Project 3B spec
--> this in-depth description of the EXT2 file system:
    http://www.nongnu.org/ext2-doc/ext2.html#def-inodes
--> the test scripts located at:
    http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/cs111/Samples/
--> this article containing a demonstration of the csv library for python:
    https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/working-csv-files-python/
--> this article which provided an overview of code to convert an octal number to a decimal number:

FEATURES:
    All features specified in the Project 3B spec were implemented in the "lab3b.py" script, including
    block consistency audits, inode allocation audits, directory consistency audits, and error
    handling for invalid arguments.


LIMITATIONS:
    At the time of submission, no limitations were notable, relative to the descriptions of proper
    functionality provided in the Project 3B spec.


TESTING METHODOLOGY
    Testing was performed fist by printing to sdout and stderr, then by running the program on 
    all 22 test scripts located at http://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/cs111/Samples/, then by
    creating a customized csv file to test niche consistency errors, then by running the program
    on the "trivial.csv" file provided in the last project to ensure that nothing was printed
    to stdout, and lastly by running the sanity check before submitting the tarball.
