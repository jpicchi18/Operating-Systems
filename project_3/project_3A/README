DESCRIPTION OF ALL FILES INCLUDED IN "lab3a.tar.gz":

--> lab3a.c
        A C source module that compiles into the executable "lab3a" and implements the program specified
        in the project 3A spec. This program summarizes takes as input an EXT2 image file, and it produces a
        summary of the contained EXT2 file system inside. The summary is formatted as lines of comma 
        separated values, and it contains the following information:
            --> superblock summary ... information about key overarching file system parameters
            --> group summary ... information about each block group in the file system
            --> free block entires ... a report of each free block in the file system, based on readings
                                        of the free block bitmap
            --> free inode entries ... a report of each free inode in the file system, based on readings
                                        of the free inodes bitmap
            --> I-node summary ... key information about each allocated inode in the system
            --> directory entries ... key information about each entry in a given directory
            --> indirect block references ... key information about each of the blocks pointed to by
                                                allocated indirect blocks in the file system

--> ext2_fs.h
        A simplified version of a Linux header file that defines the format of the EXT2 file system. This
        contains many of the data structures and macros employed in the "lab3a.c" program implementation.

--> Makefile
        A Makefile to build and run the program. This Makefile includes the following targets:
            --> lab3a (default)
                    compiles and builds the "lab3a" executable using "gcc" and the "-Wall" and "-Wextra"
                    options. It requires "lab3a.c" and "ext2_fs.h" as file dependencies.

            --> dist 
                    builds the compressed tarball "lab3a-605124511.tar.gz" that contains the files described
                    in this README.

            --> clean
                    removes the files "lab3a-605124511.tar.gz" and "lab3a" from the current working
                    directory.

--> README
        The file you are currently reading. It contains descriptions of the files included in the 
        "lab3a-605124511.tar.gz" tarball, as well as descriptions of the features, testing methodology,
        and other details relevant to the "lab3a" executable program.

TESTING METHODOLOGY:
Testing was performed initially by comparing the output of the "lab3a" executable to the contents of
"trivial.csv". Once the program successfully produced the correct output when invoked with
"trivial.img" as an argument, further testing was performed using the "P3A_check.sh" script to ensure
that it properly handles single, double, and triple indirect blocks. GDB was used minimally in the
development process as well.


FEATURES:
All features enumerated in the project 3A spec have been implemented, with no additional features added
by intention.


LIMITATIONS:
No limitations in the program implementation were evident to me at the time of submission.
