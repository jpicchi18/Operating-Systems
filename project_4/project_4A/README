DESCRIPTION OF THE FILES IN "lab4a.tar.gz":
    
    "my_beaglebone.png"
            A selfie of me holding my assembled beaglebone, showing the front
            of the beaglebone board, as the beaglebone is connected via USB
            to my computer.

    "connected.png"
            A screenshot from a USB terminal command session on my beaglebone, which
            indicates that I changed the name of the beaglebone and configured 
            network access by connecting it to my home WIFI.

    "copy.png"
            A screenshot from a local terminal command session in which I copied
            a trivial hello world program called "hello_world.c" from my laptop
            to my beaglebone.
        
    "build_run.png"
            A screenshot from a WIFI SSH session in which I built the trivial
            hello world program using "gcc" and ran the program on the
            beaglebone.

    "git.png"
            A screenshot from a WIFI SSH session in which I installed the "git"
            version control software using the commands "sudo apt-get update" and
            "sudo apt-get install", and I cloned a repository called "test_repo"
            to my beaglebone.

    "Makefile" 
            A makefile containing the following targets:
                "dist"
                    creates the tarball "lab4a-605124511.tar.gz", which contains all
                    of the files described in this README.
                "clean"
                    removes the tarball "lab4a-605124511.tar.gz".

    "README"
            The file you are currently reading.
